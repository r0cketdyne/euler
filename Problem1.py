<p>If we list all the natural numbers below $10$ that are multiples of $3$ or $5$, we get $3, 5, 6$ and $9$. The sum of these multiples is $23$.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$.</p>

"""
Loop through numbers: Use a loop to iterate through all the natural numbers below 1000.

Check for multiples: Within the loop, check if the current number is a multiple of 3 or 5. You can use the modulo operator % for this.

Sum the multiples: Keep a running sum of the multiples you find.

Control the loop: Make sure your loop only considers numbers below 1000.

Output the result: Once the loop is complete, print or return the sum of the multiples you found.
